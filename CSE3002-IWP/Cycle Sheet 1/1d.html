        <h2><u>War and Peace</u></h2>
        <h3><u>Leo Tolstoy</u></h3>
        <p>
            In Russia's struggle with Napoleon, Tolstoy saw a tragedy that involved all mankind. 
            <strong><em>Greater</em></strong> than a historical chronicle, War and Peace is an affirmation of life itself, 
            'a <strong><em>complete</em></strong> picture', as a contemporary reviewer put it, 
            'of everything in which people find their happiness and greatness, their grief and humiliation'.
